# RESTful & Resourceful Routing

## Objectives

1. Identify and use RESTful and Resourceful routes

## Routing

A route is a url, a web endpoint, a path, or you might just call it a link. Routes are just strings, they can look like anything at all. But we want to follow conventions right??? So we use RESTful and Resourceful routes.
