## Template project

We are just over half way through our course! So far you've gotten initial practice in the following competencies:

1. Bootstrapping an Express project.
1. Managing the request-response cycle in Express and return JSON and render HTML templates.
1. Adding middleware to an Express project to achieve your goals.
1. Using a document-based Mongo database to persist data.
1. Create embedded and reference associations between documents in your NoSQL db.
1. Achieve simple manipulations of the DOM using jQuery selectors, listeners, and events.
1. Authenticate a user using the cutting-edge JWT protocol of authentication.
1. Save data in cookies on the client and read those cookies on the server.
1. Secure webhooks with authentication and authorize various users for access to them.

Next steps are to complete **Advanced Authentication Challenges**. After completing those, next steps are to create a **Portfolio Product** using ExpressJS.

## Advanced Authentication Challenges (3 Days)

2. Add "Forgot your password?" functionality. Can you do it with email? What about text? (2 days)
3. Add client-side validation using the jQuery Validate plugin for your login and registration pages. (2 hours)

## Product Challenges
