# Full-Stack-JS-1

The web is a very fun place to build things! There is no quicker and more readily available way to share information and enter into commerce than the internet, and there's no faster way than to build a website and web server.

In this course the goal will be to explore the major patterns that make up the web and websites. Instead of being bogged down with questions like "what framework/language is the best?" we will just focus on JavaScript and NodeJS and use this enormously popular framework to learn these web patterns that are repeated in every language and framework. For example, any web framework or language will be able to do authentication. We will use the `bcrypt-js` npm module to encrypt passwords for authentication. In Ruby on Rails you would use the `bcrypt` ruby gem, and in Python or Django you would use the `bcrypt` package, and in Elixir you would use the `comeonin` library (which uses bcrypt under the hood!). Once you have mastered the patterns and major paradigms of the web, you can easily grab another framework in another language and be a success.

The web is becoming ever more JavaScripty. Initially the red-headed stepchild of the internet world, JavaScript has now risen to being, by many metrics, the fastest growing language on the web. Now with the invention of NodeJS, you can write your client and your server in JS creating interesting synergies and benefits across a stack and within a development team. Also with the emergence of tools like React Native, Ionic, Johnny-Five, and many others, JavaScript is becoming a versatile tool across many platforms even outside of the desktop and mobile web browsers.
