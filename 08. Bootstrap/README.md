## Overview

Remember that Convention over Configuration is a way to gain in development speed, code reusability, and to cope with unexpected edge cases. Well we can use CoC on the front end as well as the back end. We will first be learning how to use Bootstrap to learn the conventions of web design, and then in future classes we will learn how to write completely custom CSS code. For now though, we just need things to look OK.

Much like Picasso who first mastered the traditional painting techniques before launching off to invent modern art.
